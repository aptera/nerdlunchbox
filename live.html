            <p>Yeah, videos are cool. But have you ever had your mind-noodles baked by a real live human colleague with
                a slide deck?</p>

            <p>On the second Thursday of every month, we here at Nerd Lunch industries will host a presentation put on
                by one of your fellow Apterans. This is an awesome way to kick back with your victuals and go spelunking
                in the knowledge of your coworkers. </p>

            <h4 id="toc_3">Call for speakers</h4>

            <p>Hey, nerds (of all stripes, not just coders)!
                Show the rest of us what you've been hoarding up there in your brain holes.</p>

            <p>Do you have a talk ready to give? Want to put some pressure on yourself to try something new and awesome
                in front of a few friends?</p>

            <p>Maybe you just want attention? (Me too.)</p>

            <h4><a href="http://bit.ly/nerdlunchlive">Submit your talk here</a></h4>
